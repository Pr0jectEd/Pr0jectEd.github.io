Exceptions.

There are two type of errors:
    -Bug 
    (Array of four elements, and i try to acces the fifth)
    (Error conversion, infinite loop, applicative errors)
    -Applicatives:
    (Trying to acces a page that doesnt exist on my web site)
    (Mismatch in the logic of a projec (Requirement Analisis))
    (Filling a Form with invalid fields)

Several grades of errors:
    -Fatal Error (Black) -Stopes the program-
    -Error  (Red)
    -Warning (Orange)
    -OK (Green)

The exceptions should be treated by hand (the programmer himself)
The errors SHOULD BE STORED!

Example of try catch:
try {
  code that can throw exceptions
} catch(Exception $e) {
  code that runs when an exception is caught
} 

Example of try catch with finally:

try {
  code that can throw exceptions
} catch(Exception $e) {
  code that runs when an exception is caught
} finally {
  code that always runs regardless of whether an exception was caught
}
